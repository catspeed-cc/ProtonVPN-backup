# ProtonVPN-mirror

A repository to backup and make copies of ProtonVPN source code

Why? Because ProtonVPN is openly making use of open source projects using the GPL but wants to prohibit anyone from making forks of their repositories and modifying the code. This is a clear violation of the GPL v3.0 license which ProtonVPN uses inside their own projects.

Change the license, or allow open source to do it's thing. Your license explicitly permits me to copy, modify, and redistribute the source code.

And if you change the license, be prepared for me to flag your account, for violating Github TOS that states you MUST allow forking of your projects.

I will upload all of the backups on my gitea under it's own repository for anyone to download and use to their heart's content.

Updating readme later :)
