# ProtonVPN-backup

A script to backup and make copies of ProtonVPN github repositories

Why? Because ProtonVPN is openly making use of open source projects using the GPL but wants to prohibit anyone from making forks of their repositories and modifying the code (and running modified code or taking snippets). This is a clear violation of the GPL v3.0 license which ProtonVPN uses inside their own projects.

Change the license, or allow open source to do it's thing. Your current license explicitly permits me to copy, modify, and redistribute the source code. There are other additional permissions too - commercial use, Patent use & Private use.

I will upload all of the backups on my gitea under it's own repository for anyone to download and use to their heart's content.

Updating readme later :)
